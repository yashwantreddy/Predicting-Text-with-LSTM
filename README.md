### Predicting-Text-with-LSTM

#Definition

Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a class of Deep Learning networks that have tremendous learning potential and are widely used in modern Deep Learning applications. For this project, I will specifically be using a Generative LSTM.

This is a simple Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network model that trains on a given text, or in some advanced cases- books, and learns the style of text and the usage of vocabulary. It basically learns the style of writing and attempts to replicate/generate new plausible sentences.

#Data
The data can be any form of text, a short story or an entire novel. The model might take an extremely long time to train on larger bodies of text if there is no dedicated GPU.
